###ISSUES AND PROBLEM SOLVING.
1. The biggest issue I had during this project was getting the data from my txt file to appear.
2. Things I need to work on is not getting caught up on one piece of code. Work out other pieces of the project and come back to the issue at hand. Other wise you will waste time.
